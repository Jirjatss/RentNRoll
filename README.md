Confused about finding a vehicle rental? Rent N Roll: Your travel solution 🚗🛵🚲🛴

Originating from the personal concern of my group mate who often felt difficulties in finding a vehicle rental when traveling or vacationing out of town. Whenever they wanted to explore a city or a place they were visiting, they struggled to find a rental place, and even if they did, the vehicle was often unavailable or fully booked. ❌❌

From this concern, our group eventually discussed and developed the initial idea to create a rental application that we named Rent N Roll. 🎉🎉🎉

This application features the ability to search for rental vehicles based on location, category, and even by the vehicle's name. Additionally, you can also view and check details of the selected vehicle, such as color, fuel type, transmission, and year. Since this is a rental app, of course, our application has an online booking feature ✅. You just need to register or log in if you already have an account, then upload the required documents like a selfie, ID card, and driving license if necessary. Once done, you can place an order and make a payment 💳💵, and voila, your vehicle is ready for pick-up 🚗🛸. Another feature of our application is that besides renting vehicles, you can also offer your own vehicles for rent 💹🤑 by pressing the 'add vehicle' button, where you can upload photos of your vehicle along with information about it, and you can accept orders. Moreover, you can also communicate with other users using the chat feature 💬
